# module04-challenge - Mandela Effect Challenge/Quiz

## Description

How accurate is your memory? The passing of Nelson Mandela in 2013 triggered a world wild realization that things aren't always how we remember them. People upon people began to compare their memories after distinctly remembering Mandela died in prison in the 1980s. The phenomenon is shocking to most, to think something happened one way when it was another. How well do you think your memory is? -- Take the Mandela Effect Challenge (insert deployed link here) and put your memory to the test! 

The quiz consists of 12 pop-culture related questions that you will need to answer within 90 seconds. That being said, make sure you're certain of your answer. Every time an answer is chosen incorrectly, 10 seconds will be deducted from your current time.

Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript I was able to create an interactive site to host the game. By properly writing and organizing the code 

During this creating of this project, I learned the value of:
- The Document Object
    - The Document Object in JavaScript has a multitude of properties and methods that can access and manipulate your HTML to provide creative functionality. This site uses the .getElementById method and .addEventListener method many times to use the HTML obtain goals like button pressing and displaying different boxes.
- Local Storage
    - What fun is a game if you can't keep track of your score and other's scores? Local storage allows the site to save the current players information (name, score, date) so they can play the game again and compare their progress. In addition, the player could then compare their scores with any friends who play as well.
